          The lion is a strong animal with a strong body, a big head, a majestic
           mane, and two fierce eyes. Lions are predatory animals and eat only 
           after hunting. They have strong claws and sharp teeth, which help 
           them hunt their prey and eat the flesh. Lions have yellowish-grey 
           skin colour with smooth hair and an imperious roar which makes a lion
            unique. The footprints of lions are called pug marks. Lions are found 
            chiefly in grasslands, open woodlands, or enclosed in zoos. Since they 
            kill their own prey and hunt for food, they have the capacity to run fast.
